/**
    A class protocol allowing notification of a characteristic being listened on, and provides an opportunity to restore its listen callback during Bluetooth state restoration.
 
    Bluetooth state restoration occurs when the background mode capability is turned on, and if the app is backgrounded or even terminated while a Bluetooth operation is still ongoing, iOS may keep the Bluetooth state alive, and attempt to restore it on resuming the app, so that the connection and operation between the app and the Bluetooth accessory is not interrupted and severed.
 
    - Note: Use the function `restoreListen` in Bluejay to restore the desired callback for the given characteristic and return true. Return false to prevent restoration, as well as to cancel the listening on the given characteristic.
